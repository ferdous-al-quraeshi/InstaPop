# InstaPop
This project was a first-hand experience of **getting-started-with-Node.js**. This project serves as a full-fledged **Node.js-based web application** where only popular *Instagram photos* will be displayed along with their *likes & comments count* using the *Instagram Developer API* services.

### Techs used:
 - Express [*as the Node framework*]
 - Instagram-node [*facilitate using the Instagram API with Node (i.e. Express)*]
 - Embedded JavaScript (EJS) [*supports templating a Node app as like AngularJS or such*]
 - Bootstrap (CSS) [*served as an agile stylizer*]

### Skills earned:
 - learned how to program with **Node** as the back-end using **[Express](http://expressjs.com/ "Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js")** framework
 - using a popular *API Explorer*- in this case, **[apigee](https://apigee.com/resources/instagram "Instagram API Resources")**
 - learned a *new* JavaScript *templating language*- **[EJS](http://www.embeddedjs.com/ "<% Embedded JavaScript %>")**
